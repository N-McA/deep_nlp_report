# Setup

This uses [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for the data and a filter to remove the output of notebooks (otherwise diffs are a nightmare).

Thus make sure you have lfs installed; do
'''
git lfs pull
'''
after checkout to grab the data (100s Mb) and run 
'''
./setup
'''
to use the the notebook filters.
